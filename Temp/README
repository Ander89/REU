1)  For my environment I have been using Katie and NotePad++ to edit my files. The operating systems is Kubuntu 
with Java OpenJDK8(1.8.0_40 64 bit). My file was originally located in Desktop/tinyos/Apps/Temp. 
As long as you have my folder inside of the Apps within the Tinyos folder then program should run fine.
2.) To run my program I use the command  "sudo make iris install mib520,/dev/ttyUSB0 the USB0 
might change depending on how many motes you have plugged into your computer.
You have to be in the directory temp for this command to work. The program will then be installed onto the chip. 
Then to see the output use the command: 
'sudo java net.tinyos.tools.PrintfClient -comm seria@/dev/ttyX:iris'(X being whatever usb port you are writing too).
Ignore the first couple values stating "bad packet and that the packet is too long". wait about 5 seconds and you should see the
words "temperature sent from this mote"and a value in Celsius along with the temperature received from other motes.
Also if the temperature is below or above a certain amount a message corresponding to the threshold 
that is set in the program will appear.
3) When running the java command the temperature that is being sent and the temperature that is being received will output to the
screen. Putting your finger on the sensor will change the temperature and the output from the screen will
increase/decrease when you touch the sensor directly as well as moving to a room with a different temp than the original room.
4) After you have installed and burned the image to the mote a red light should blink showing that a message has been sent 
from the mote, a yellow light should be blinking showing that a message has been received by that mote.
The green light should be on showing that the mote has been booted. 
After you see all of these lights run the java command mentioned in step 2 and the output 
described in step 2 will be seen on your screen.
